# churn-prediction-ml
Machine learning project to predict customer churn based on historical data using classification models. Includes EDA, model training, and deployment-ready code.
# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to stop using their service so that proactive retention strategies can be applied.

The Jupyter notebook `churnprediction.ipynb` includes:
- ðŸ“ˆ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- ðŸ§¼ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- ðŸ§  **Machine Learning Models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- ðŸ“‰ **Evaluation Metrics** (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- ðŸ’¾ **Model Saving for Deployment**

## ðŸ§  Goal
To build an accurate and interpretable churn prediction model that helps businesses reduce customer loss and improve engagement.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Highlights
- In-depth data analysis and visualization
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Comparison of multiple classification algorithms
- Model serialization (using joblib or pickle)
- Future-ready structure for integration into a web app or API

## âœ… Ideal Use Case
Telecom, SaaS, and subscription-based businesses aiming to improve customer retention using predictive insights.
